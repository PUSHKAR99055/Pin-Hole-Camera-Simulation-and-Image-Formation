Augment a given real-world image of a 3D scene (e.g. live broadcast of a sporting event) by introducing the cube object generated by your program in the foreground of the scene. In addition, generate a 3D stereo-video of the augmented scene by introducing a second camera. The original red cube animation is combined with blue cube animation corresponding to the second (stereo) camera. If the resulting video is seen after wearing a red and blue colored eye-glasses, the cube will be perceived in 3D (as in 3D movies).
